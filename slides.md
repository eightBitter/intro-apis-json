# Intro to APIs

---

## What is an API?

- Application Programming Interface
- Building blocks for developing a computer program
- Web-based system, operating system, software library, etc
- Specifications for routines, data structures, variables, etc

Note: examples include Windows API for working with Windows OS and Android API for their development kit

---

## Web APIs

>When used in the context of web development, an API is typically a defined set of specifications, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, which is usually in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

# Intro to JSON

---

## JSON Basics

- JavaScript Object Notation is a data format
- Based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language
- Text based and language independent

## JSON Data Types

- Strings: <span style="color:red">`"name"`</span>`:` <span style="color:green">`"Jacob"`</span>
- Numbers: <span style="color:red">`"age"`</span>`:` <span style="color:orange">`30`</span>
- Objects: <span style="color:red">`"employee"`</span>`:` `{` <span style="color:red">`"name"`</span>`:`<span style="color:green">`"Jacob"`</span>`,`<span style="color:red">` "age"`</span>`:`<span style="color:orange">`30`</span>`}`
- Arrays: <span style="color:red">`"employees"`</span>`: [`<span style="color:green">`"Jacob", "Walt"`</span>`]`
- Booleans: <span style="color:red">`"librarian"`</span>`:` <span style="color:blue">`true`</span>

## Complex JSON Example

```json
{
  "paintings": [
    {
      "name": "The Scream",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream",
      "creator": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "Edvard Munch",
        "sameAs": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Munch"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Melancholy",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholy_(Edvard_Munch)",
      "creator": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "Edvard Munch",
        "sameAs": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Munch"
      }
    }
  ]

# Scavenger Hunt! Explore SWAPI

---

## What is SWAPI?

[swapi.co](https://swapi.co)

- Star Wars API
- Structured data about episodic Star Wars films, up through The Force Awakens
- Info about films, people, planets, species, starships, vehicles (entities)
---

## Navigating SWAPI

[swapi.co](https://swapi.co)

- Data organized into buckets
- https://swapi.co/api/people returns data about all people
- https://swapi.co/api/people/1 returns data about the first person in the index, Luke Skywalker
- Each entity is connected to other entities by nesting URLs

```JSON
{
  "name": "Luke Skywalker",
  "films": [
    "https://swapi.co/api/films/2/"
  ],
  "species": [
    "https://swapi.co/api/species/1/"
  ]
}
```

## Instructions

Using your browser, explore SWAPI and answer these questions:

1. Which movies did George Lucas produce?
2. When was The Force Awakens released?
3. According to the API, which planets were featured in The Empire Strikes Back?
  - Which of these planets has the highest pop?
